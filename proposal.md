# Waves of Seeing

## What is the overarching area of research?

Information Theory.

## What are the key questions or queries you will address?

What is information, particularly in regards to concepts like meaning, truth, and representation?

## Why are you motivated to undertake this project?

There exists a wide set of 21st century critical, theoretical, and philosophical approaches<sup>0</sup> to the humanities, arts, and social sciences where a traditionally human-centered discourse has been replanted in a 'non-human' or agent-centered<sup>1</sup> light. These approaches, both complimentary and contradictory, have been aptly grouped together in the 'Nonhuman Turn' classification. Approaches within the Nonhuman Turn can be particularly informative for contemporary visual arts practices, especially those working with software.

While The Nonhuman Turn is grounded in the 21st century, it has a long geneology rooted in, but not limited to, western thinkers like Lucretius, Walt Whitman<sup>2</sup>, Charles Darwin, William James, Walter Benjamin, and Marshall McLuhan. When exploring the wider geneology, I find myself drawn to Claude Shannon, creator of infomation theory, who I assume would aptly wear the contemporary Nonhuman Turn badge, if he didn't, in fact, find the badge too obvious and unnecessary. This Shannonian focus follows a curve of questioning that asked what is human and what is agent, and now asks what is information, particularly in regards to concepts like representation, meaning, and truth.

I feel that exploring this, perhaps elemental, question will bring more clarity and awareness to my human-ness, my agent-ness, and my information-ness within systems.    


0. The Nonhuman Turn classification includes, but is not limited to Actor-network Theory, Affect Theory and by extension Queer Theory, Animal Studies and Speciesism, Assemblage Theory - Deleuze/DeLanda/Latour/etc, Artificial Intelligence and other 'new' brain sciences, New Materialism, New Media Theory, Speculative Realism, and Systems Theory. 

1. Sam Ludford and I explored the contextual concept of agency in the project <i>Interagency</i>.

2. Whitman and William James being influencers in my earlier work looking at what is knowable in <i>Eidolon</i> and what is meaningful <i>Eeldrop and Appleplex</i>.

## What theoretical frameworks will you use in your work to guide you?


## What theoretical frameworks will you use in the analysis of your project?

Walkthrough method rooted in Actor-network Theory.


## How will you document your project?

I want to make a programmatically-illustrated question-and-answer book. Perhaps interactive in a web-book format as seen in some projects on JAR but with JavaScript and the P5 library or in a static physical printed book form. As the project develops I can use the walkthrough method in a remixed way to analyze which form is best suited for the content. 

Each page will have a simple question with a simple answer - both read by user, no formal user input - accompanied by a programatically created visualization that correlates with the text. Each question/answer set will have a more in dept analysis placed in the back of the book or as a lightbox as a reference for the more curious reader - a footnote and diving board of sorts for leading the curious.

The book will be intended to look and feel almost unsubstantial and definitely unintimidating. Small in size, clear in content, understated-translucent aesthetic, a fixed Socratic Method for information. It will be written for a teenage+ audience as perhaps an intro to information and thereby representation and computational thinking. I would possibly use this as a teaching tool in the future.

Perhaps 20 pages in total. I will keep documentary screenshots and sketchs that show the development of the project as a whole - text, code, concept, presentation. I will use git throughout the process to become more familiar with git as a workflow tool. I will blog about the different pages and the ideas that are contained within them.
